# Java Interactive Data Structures Demo

## About

This Java program allows users to select from four common data structures and interactively perform their typical operations step-by-step:
## Sample Screenshots

The program updates and prints the current state of the selected data structure after every operation.

Each data structure implementation is modularized into its own class file, with a main driver program managing user interaction.

## How It Works

1. On launch, the user chooses a data structure from the menu.
2. For the selected structure, operations are offered via a submenu.
3. User inputs guide insertion, deletion, or display commands.
4. Results and updated contents are printed after each operation.
5. User can exit.
